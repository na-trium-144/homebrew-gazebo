# The script will print the unbottled dependencies from the osrf/simulation
# tap of a specified formula.
#
# Usage:
# $ ./unbottled_dependencies.sh <formula>
#
# For example, to print the unbottled dependencies of gz-harmonic from the
# osrf/simulation tap:
#
# ./unbottled_dependencies.sh gz-harmonic

FORMULA=${1}

  # but has different output for formulae that are "ready to bottle" or
  # that have "unbottled deps". So just echo the name of any formula for which
  # `brew unbottled` doesn't print "already bottled"
