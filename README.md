===================

Homebrew tap for osrf simulation software

[![brew test-bot](https://github.com/na-trium-144/homebrew-gazebo/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?event=pull_request)](https://github.com/na-trium-144/homebrew-gazebo/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This is a fork of osrf/simulation, where bottles of gazebo11 and its dependencies for MacOS Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma and Linux are built with Github Action.
Other versions of gazebo are disabled to speed up build.

To use:

    brew tap na-trium-144/gazebo
    brew install gazebo11
